Welcome to my Scavenging repo. 

Section 1, What is this?: 
  This is my Scavening repo, In other words this is where I put scripts I find across github that I find to be interesting, useful and or helpful. 
   This includes: Tutorials, Utilities / Librarys, Game specific scripts, Universal Scripts, Fun scripts (Primarly concept scripts) 

Section 2, Why?: 
  I scavange GitHub a lot as you can tell by my Ui-Library repo, 80% of those UIs were found manually instead of being given to me. That's why you might not recognize all of them. 
  I've made created this to allow recognition for other scripters who I appreciate their contribution to this community and hopefully allowing them to be recognized through me and highlighting the good scripters we still have in our community.

Section 3, How can I be featured here?: 
  The majority of these (Finishing writing later)
